# Introduction

Welcome to the Remarq API! You can use our API to access Remarq API endpoints, which can get information on various cats, kittens, and breeds in our database.

We have code examples for Shell and Ruby! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate).

The source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jagthedrummer/remarq_api_docs). Feel free suggest modifications or to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.

## JSON API Standard

The Remarq API uses the [JSON API standard](http://jsonapi.org/). The
arrangement of endpoints and the structure of reqeust and response data
is based on that standard.

The [official list of JSON API implementations](http://jsonapi.org/implementations/) is a good place to look for tools to help with client implementations.
